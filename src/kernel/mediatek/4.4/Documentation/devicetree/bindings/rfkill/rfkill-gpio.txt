GPIO controlled RFKILL devices

Required properties:
- compatible	: Must be "rfkill-gpio".
- rfkill-name	: Name of RFKILL device.
- rfkill-type	: Type of RFKILL device: 1 for WiFi, 2 for BlueTooth, etc.
		  See include/uapi/linux/rfkill.h for all valid values.
- shutdown-gpios: GPIO phandle to set state
- reset-gpios   : GPIO phandle to set state, at least one of the two GPIOs need to be defined.
		  If both are provided, the "reset" gpio is toggled first.

Optional properties:
- default-state : Initial state set by driver (<1> = blocked <0> = unblocked).

Example:

	rfkill_bt {
		compatible = "rfkill-gpio";
		rfkill-name = "bluetooth";
		rfkill-type = <2>;
		shutdown-gpios = <&pio 1 0>;
	};
